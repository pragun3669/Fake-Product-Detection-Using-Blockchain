# Fake Product Detection Using Blockchain

This project is a **Blockchain-based Product Verification System** designed to detect counterfeit products in the B2C supply chain.  
By leveraging the immutability and transparency of the Ethereum blockchain, it ensures that each product can be verified as genuine, benefiting both manufacturers (in terms of brand trust and transparency) and consumers (in ensuring authenticity).

## 🚀 Features

- Secure **on-chain registration** of products using unique identifiers and cryptographic hashes.
- Real-time **verification of authenticity** by scanning or entering product details.
- **Tamper-proof product data** stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Decentralized validation — no central authority required.
- **Transparent audit trail** of product history from manufacturer to end customer.
